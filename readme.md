## Way of adding
When working on something new, lets say to draw our first triangle.  
Let's make a new branch, lets call it draw-first-triangle, and apply changes to it instead of master.  
Then, to apply changes to master, rebase the branch onto the master.  
This strategy is intended to keep track of each feature additions seperately to review afterwards.  
It is like each feature branch will be a tutorial.
